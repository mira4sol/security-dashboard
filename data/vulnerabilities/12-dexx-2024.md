On November 16, 2024, the cryptocurrency world was shaken by a significant security breach targeting DEXX, a decentralized exchange and memecoin trading platform built on the Solana blockchain. The incident, which resulted in estimated losses of $30 million, affected over 8,600 Solana wallets and at least 900 unique users. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the DEXX hack, exploring its causes, impact, response, and broader implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Drawing from multiple sources, we aim to present a detailed and critical analysis of the event.

##Background: What is DEXX?

DEXX is an on-chain trading terminal primarily focused on memecoins—cryptocurrencies often driven by internet culture and speculative trading. Operating on the Solana blockchain, DEXX offered users a platform to trade these volatile assets with a centralized custody model, where the platform controlled users’ private keys to simplify transactions. This design, while user-friendly, introduced significant security risks, as it created a single point of failure. The platform had gained traction in the memecoin trading community, partly due to aggressive marketing through referral links and endorsements by key opinion leaders (KOLs). However, its security practices came under scrutiny following the November 16 exploit.

##The Hack: What Happened?

The DEXX hack was first reported on November 16, 2024, when multiple users noticed unauthorized transfers of their funds from the platform. The breach was traced to a private key leak within DEXX’s centralized custody system, which allowed the attacker to access and transfer assets from user wallets. According to blockchain security firm SlowMist, the hack impacted over 8,620 Solana wallets, with losses initially estimated at $21 million but later revised to $30 million due to fluctuations in memecoin prices.

## Key Details of the Exploit

- Scale of the Attack: The hack affected at least 900 unique users, with most victims losing less than $10,000, though one individual suffered a loss exceeding $1 million. Over 9,000 unauthorized transactions were recorded, indicating a highly coordinated and methodical attack.

- Method of Attack: The attacker exploited a vulnerability in DEXX’s private key management. SlowMist’s founder, Yu Xian (Cos), noted that the private keys were held in DEXX’s centralized custody, making them a prime target. The exact method of the leak—whether through insider theft, external hacking, or a system flaw—remains under investigation.

- Asset Conversion: The hacker converted stolen assets, primarily memecoins, into Solana (SOL) tokens, complicating recovery efforts. Some funds were later laundered through Tornado Cash, a privacy protocol, with SlowMist reporting that 6,432.4 ETH (valued at approximately $19,446) was moved through this service.

- Victim Addresses: SlowMist’s investigation identified 8,848 victim addresses on the Solana chain and 7,205 on EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Base), highlighting the cross-chain scope of the attack.

## Timeline of Events

- November 16, Early Morning: Users reported unauthorized fund transfers, and memecoins like BAN, LUCE, and PNUT experienced significant sell-offs, with price drops of 12.5% to 30%. SlowMist began receiving reports of the breach around 3:00 AM, noting that the attacker was swapping tokens for SOL.

- November 16, Morning: DEXX founder Roy issued a statement acknowledging the hack and promising user compensation. SlowMist estimated losses in the tens of millions, with community rumors suggesting up to $16 million initially.

- November 28: SlowMist’s MistTrack team published a list of hacker addresses, urging the community to monitor them for suspicious activity.

- November 29: Losses were revised to $30 million, making the DEXX hack the largest crypto exploit of November 2024, surpassing the $25.5 million Thala Labs hack (which was fully recovered).

- December 4: SlowMist released an updated list of victim and attacker addresses, noting that the investigation was ongoing to refine the data and address false positives.

- December 17: SlowMist reported that the hacker had laundered significant funds through Tornado Cash, with the investigation nearing its conclusion.

## Impact on Users and the Market

The DEXX hack had profound consequences for both individual users and the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly within the Solana ecosystem.

## User Losses

The financial impact on users varied widely. While most victims lost less than $10,000, the single largest loss exceeded $1 million, underscoring the uneven distribution of damage. The emotional toll was significant, as users expressed frustration and anger, particularly toward DEXX’s security practices and KOLs who had promoted the platform. Some users jokingly remarked that DEXX had “redefined non-custodial wallets,” highlighting the irony of a platform meant to empower users leaving them vulnerable.

## Market Repercussions

The hack triggered immediate sell-offs of memecoins traded on DEXX, with tokens like BAN (-30%), LUCE (-20%), and PNUT (-12.5%) experiencing sharp declines. These price drops were exacerbated by the volatile nature of memecoins, which contributed to the increased loss estimates. The incident also sparked panic in the broader Solana ecosystem, raising concerns about wallet security and the reliability of centralized custody models.

##Broader Context

The DEXX hack was part of a wave of crypto exploits in November 2024, which saw $71 million stolen across multiple incidents. The year’s total crypto losses reached $1.48 billion, a 15% decrease from 2023 but still indicative of persistent vulnerabilities. High-profile hacks earlier in the year, such as the $305 million DMM Bitcoin exchange breach and the $235 million WazirX exploit, underscored the ongoing challenges in securing crypto platforms.

## Response and Recovery Efforts

DEXX and its partners took several steps to address the fallout from the hack, though recovery efforts faced significant hurdles.

### DEXX’s Response
- Acknowledgment and Compensation: DEXX founder Roy announced that the platform was collaborating with law enforcement and security firms like SlowMist to identify the hacker and recover funds. Roy committed to compensating affected users, but reimbursement plans were contingent on recovering stolen assets. A new compensation address was introduced, as the hacker’s control of private keys made original routes unviable.

- Security Upgrades: DEXX halted deposits and began upgrading its security protocols. However, some users ignored warnings and continued depositing funds, resulting in additional thefts due to the hacker’s active script.

- Bounty Offer: DEXX offered a bug bounty and token rewards to incentivize the hacker to return the funds, but no agreement was reached

## SlowMist’s Investigation

SlowMist played a central role in analyzing the hack and tracking stolen funds. Key actions included:
Address Tracking: SlowMist’s MistTrack team identified over 8,600 suspicious Solana wallets and later expanded the investigation to EVM chains, releasing lists of victim and attacker addresses.

Fund Monitoring: The firm reported that the hacker laundered funds through Tornado Cash and tracked remaining balances across...
